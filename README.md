# calculator

First serious project of mine, I'd say. Didn't put too much effort into the CSS, I just wanted to page to look presentable.
Did this to practice my JavaScript programming. Made everything up from scratch, including the way you compute a given formula. It's a Shunting Yard algorithm which uses a stack to reorganize and then do the operations in the proper order.

Took me 2 days, about 2-4 hours/work session.

You can use your keyboard to input numbers / operations.
